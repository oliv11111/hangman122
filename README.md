## Description
The Hangman Project in Python is the second project for the AiCore course. The aim of this project is to implement a simple Hangman game where players can guess a word by suggesting letters. The project is organized into five milestones, each building upon the previous one, providing a structured approach to learning and implementing the game.

### What it does
The Hangman game  allows players to guess a word by suggesting individual letters. With each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn, and the player must guess the word before the figure is completed. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

### Project Objectives
- Reinforce Python programming skills.
- Practice working with strings, lists, and loops.
- Implement a simple user interface for interacting with the game.


### What You Will Learn
- String manipulation in Python.
- Handling user input and implementing game mechanics.
- Structuring and organizing code for a simple project.

## Installation
To run the Hangman game, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oliv11111/hangman122.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd hangman122
    ```

3. Run the game script for Milestone 4. NOTE: This is only for the current stage in development
    ```bash
    python milestone_4.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the game is installed, follow these instructions to play the Hangman game:

1. Run the Milestone 2 script as mentioned in the installation instructions.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions

## File Structure
The project follows a simple file structure:
- `milestone_2.py`: The old script containing the Milestone 2 implementation of the Hangman game.
- 'milestone_4.py': The current implementation of the Hangman game.
- `README.md`: Documentation file for the project.

## Milestones
The project is organized into five milestones:

1. <span style='color: green'>Milestone 1: Enviroment set-up (git repo, etc...)
2. <span style='color: green'>Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game (located in `milestone_2.py`).
3. <span style='color: green'>Milestone 3: Check if guessed character is in the word (located in `milestone_2.py`)
4. <span style='color: red'>Milestone 4: Create the Game class (located in 'milestone_4.py)
5. <span style='color: red'>Milestone 5: Putting it all together

Each milestone builds upon the previous one, providing a structured learning path.
